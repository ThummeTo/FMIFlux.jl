    "## Introduction\n",
    "NeuralODEs lead to amazing results in academic examples. But the expectations are often being disappointed as soon as one tries to adapt this concept for real life use cases. Bad convergence behavior, handling of discontinuities and/or instabilities are just some of the stumbling blocks that might pop up during the first steps. During the workshop, we want to show how to integrate real life industrial models in NeuralODEs using FMI and present sophisticated training strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial can be used in two ways:\n",
    "1. As a single script, showing how a NeuralFMU can be setup and trained. Results can be loaded from a precomputed hyperparameter optimization.\n",
    "2. As a module (see sections *Optional: Organize as module*) together with the file `juliacon_2023_distributedhyperopt.jl` to perform your own distributed hyperparameter optimization.\n",

    "This workshops divides into five sections:\n",
