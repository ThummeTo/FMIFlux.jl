    "## Motivation\n",
    "The Julia Package *FMIFlux.jl* is motivated by the application of hybrid modeling. This package enables the user to integrate his simulation model between neural networks (NeuralFMU). For this, the simulation model must be exported as FMU (functional mock-up unit), which corresponds to a widely used standard. The big advantage of hybrid modeling with artificial neural networks is, that effects that are difficult to model (because they might be unknown) can be easily learned by the neural networks. For this purpose, the NeuralFMU is trained with measurement data containing the not modeled physical effect. The final product is a simulation model including the originally not modeled effects. Another big advantage of the NeuralFMU is that it works with little data, because the FMU already contains the characteristic functionality of the simulation and only the missing effects are added.\n",
    "\n",
    "NeuralFMUs do not need to be as easy as in this example. Basically a NeuralFMU can combine different ANN topologies that manipulate any FMU-input (system state, system inputs, time) and any FMU-output (system state derivative, system outputs, other system variables). However, for this example a NeuralFMU topology as shown in the following picture is used.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Introduction to the example\n",
    "In this example, the model of a one-dimensional spring pendulum (with an external acting force) is used to learn the initial states. For this purpose, on the one hand the initial position of the mass of the pendulum is shifted and on the other hand the default position of the mass from the model is used. The model with the shifted initial position serves as reference and is called *referenceFMU* in the following. The model with the default position is further referenced with *defaultFMU*. At the beginning, the actual state of both simulations is shown, whereby clear deviations can be seen in the graphs. Afterwards, the *defaultFMU* is integrated into a co-simulation NeuralFMU (CS-NeuralFMU) architecture. By training the NeuralFMU, an attempt is made to learn the initial displacement of the *referenceFMU*. It can be clearly seen that the NeuralFMU learns this shift well in just a few training steps. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Target group\n",
    "The example is primarily intended for users who work in the field of first principle and/or hybrid modeling and are further interested in hybrid model building. The example wants to show how simple it is to combine FMUs with machine learning and to illustrate the advantages of this approach.\n",

    "Besides, this [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/thummeto/FMIFlux.jl/blob/examples/examples/src/simple_hybrid_CS.ipynb) there is also a [Julia file](https://github.com/thummeto/FMIFlux.jl/blob/examples/examples/src/simple_hybrid_CS.jl) with the same name, which contains only the code cells and for the documentation there is a [Markdown file](https://github.com/thummeto/FMIFlux.jl/blob/examples/examples/src/simple_hybrid_CS.md) corresponding to the notebook.  \n",
