    "## Motivation\n",
    "The Julia Package *FMIFlux.jl* is motivated by the application of hybrid modeling. This package enables the user to integrate his simulation model between neural networks (NeuralFMU). For this, the simulation model must be exported as FMU (functional mock-up unit), which corresponds to a widely used standard. The big advantage of hybrid modeling with artificial neural networks is, that effects that are difficult to model (because they might be unknown) can be easily learned by the neural networks. For this purpose, the NeuralFMU is trained with measurement data containing the not modeled physical effect. The final product is a simulation model including the originally not modeled effects. Another big advantage of the NeuralFMU is that it works with little data, because the FMU already contains the characteristic functionality of the simulation and only the missing effects are added.\n",
    "\n",
    "NeuralFMUs do not need to be as easy as in this example. Basically a NeuralFMU can combine different ANN topologies that manipulate any FMU-input (system state, system inputs, time) and any FMU-output (system state derivative, system outputs, other system variables). However, for this example a NeuralFMU topology as shown in the following picture is used.\n",

    "*NeuralFMU (ME) from* [[1]](#Source).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to the example\n",
    "In this example, simplified modeling of a one-dimensional spring pendulum (without friction) is compared to a model of the same system that includes a nonlinear friction model. The FMU with the simplified model will be named *simpleFMU* in the following and the model with the friction will be named *realFMU*. At the beginning, the actual state of both simulations is shown, whereby clear deviations can be seen in the graphs. The *realFMU* serves as a reference graph. The *simpleFMU* is then integrated into a NeuralFMU architecture and a training of the entire network is performed. After the training the final state is compared again to the *realFMU*. It can be clearly seen that by using the NeuralFMU, learning of the friction process has taken place.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Target group\n",
    "The example is primarily intended for users who work in the field of first principle and/or hybrid modeling and are further interested in hybrid model building. The example wants to show how simple it is to combine FMUs with machine learning and to illustrate the advantages of this approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Other formats\n",
    "Besides, this [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/thummeto/FMIFlux.jl/blob/examples/examples/src/advanced_hybrid_ME.ipynb) there is also a [Julia file](https://github.com/thummeto/FMIFlux.jl/blob/examples/examples/src/advanced_hybrid_ME.jl) with the same name, which contains only the code cells and for the documentation there is a [Markdown file](https://github.com/thummeto/FMIFlux.jl/blob/examples/examples/src/advanced_hybrid_ME.md) corresponding to the notebook.  \n",

The ME-FMU computes the state derivatives for a given system state. Following the *simpleFMU* is a dense layer that has exactly as many inputs as the model has states (and therefore state derivatives). The output of this layer consists of 16 output nodes and a *tanh* activation function. The next layer has 16 input and output nodes with the same activation function. The last layer is again a dense layer with 16 input nodes and the number of states as outputs. Here, it is important that no *tanh*-activation function follows, because otherwise the pendulums state values would be limited to the interval $[-1;1]$."
