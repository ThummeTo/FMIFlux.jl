    "## Motivation\n",
    "The Julia Package *FMIFlux.jl* is motivated by the application of hybrid modeling. This package enables the user to integrate his simulation model between neural networks (NeuralFMU). For this, the simulation model must be exported as FMU (functional mock-up unit), which corresponds to a widely used standard. The big advantage of hybrid modeling with artificial neural networks is, that the effects that are difficult to model (because they might be unknown) can be easily learned by the neural networks. For this purpose, the NeuralFMU is trained with measurement data containing the not modeled physical effect. The final product is a simulation model including the originally not modeled effects. Another big advantage of the NeuralFMU is that it works with little data, because the FMU already contains the characteristic functionality of the simulation and only the missing effects are added.\n",
    "\n",
    "NeuralFMUs do not need to be as easy as in this example. Basically a NeuralFMU can combine different ANN topologies that manipulate any FMU-input (system state, system inputs, time) and any FMU-output (system state derivative, system outputs, other system variables). However, for this example a NeuralFMU topology as shown in the following picture is used.\n",
    "\n",

    "*NeuralFMU (ME) from* [[1]](#Source).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to the example\n",
    "In this example, simplified modeling of a one-dimensional spring pendulum (without friction) is compared to a model of the same system that includes a nonlinear friction model. The FMU with the simplified model will be named *simpleFMU* in the following and the model with the friction will be named *realFMU*. At the beginning, the actual state of both simulations is shown, whereby clear deviations can be seen in the graphs. In addition, the initial states are changed for both models and these graphs are also contrasted, and the differences can again be clearly seen. The *realFMU* serves as a reference graph. The *simpleFMU* is then integrated into a NeuralFMU architecture and a training of the entire network is performed. After the training the final state is compared again to the *realFMU*. It can be clearly seen that by using the NeuralFMU, learning of the friction process has taken place.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Target group\n",
    "The example is primarily intended for users who work in the field of first principle and/or hybrid modeling and are further interested in hybrid model building. The example wants to show how simple it is to combine FMUs with machine learning and to illustrate the advantages of this approach.\n",

It consists of a dense layer that has exactly as many inputs and outputs as the model has states `numStates` (and therefore state derivatives). It also sets the initial weights and offsets for the first dense layer, as well as the activation function, which consists of the identity. An input layer follows, which then leads into the *simpleFMU* model. The ME-FMU computes the state derivatives for a given system state. Following the *simpleFMU* is a dense layer that has `numStates` states. The output of this layer consists of 8 output nodes and a *identity* activation function. The next layer has 8 input and output nodes with a *tanh* activation function. The last layer is again a dense layer with 8 input nodes and the number of states as outputs. Here, it is important that no *tanh*-activation function follows, because otherwise the pendulums state values would be limited to the interval $[-1;1]$."

    "The code section shown here represents the training loop. The loop is structured so that it has `numRuns` runs, where each run has `numEpochs` epochs, and the training is performed at each epoch with `numIterations` iterations. In lines 9 and 10, the data for the *neuralFMU* for the default and modified initial states are appended to the corresponding vectors. The plots for the opposition of position and velocity is done in line 13 by calling the function `plot_all_results`. In the following lines the last layers are extracted from the *neuralFMU* and formed into an independent network `netBottom`. The parameters for the `netBottom` network come from the original architecture and are shared. In line 20, the new network is used to represent the friction model in a graph. An analogous construction of the next part of the training loop, where here the first layer is taken from the *neuralFMU* and converted to its own network `netTop`. This network is used to record the displacement model. The different graphs are generated for each run and can thus be compared. "
