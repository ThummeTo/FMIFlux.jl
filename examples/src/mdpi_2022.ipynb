        "## Introduction\n",
        "In this tutorial, a *vehicle longitudinal-dynamics model* (VLDM) as used in automotive industry, is extended to a NeuralFMU (PeNODE) to make better consumption predictions. You don't know what NeuralFMUs/PeNODEs are? No problem, this will be briefly explained during this tutorial, too.\n",
        "\n",
        "This tutorial is a more easy, code-focussed version of the paper [[1]](#Source), if you find it useful for your work, please cite the linked paper. In this example, a real-world simulation model is enhanced in terms of accuracy using a so called *physics-enhanced neural ordinary differential equation* (PeNode). Basically, this is an extension to the NeuralODE concept and looks as can be seen in Fig. 1.\n",
        "\n",
        "![NeuralFMU.svg](https://github.com/thummeto/FMIFlux.jl/blob/main/docs/src/examples/img/mdpi_2022/neuralfmu.svg?raw=true)\n",
        "\n",
        "*Fig.1: A possible representation for a physics-enhanced neural ordinary differential equation (PeNODE). An ODE model computes the system state derivative $\\dot{\\vec{x}}$ based on a given system state $\\vec{x}$, inputs $\\vec{u}$ and time $t$. The state derivative $\\dot{\\vec{x}}$ is manipulated by the ANN into $\\hat{\\dot{\\vec{x}}}$ and finally integrated into the next system state $\\vec{x}(t+h)$. PeNODEs that include FMUs instead of symbolic ODEs are called NeuralFMUs.*\n",
        "\n",
        "Note, that this is only one possible topology of a PeNODE, there could be an additional artifical neural network (ANN) before the ODE (that might share some connections with the other ANN). Further also other signals, like FMU state derivatives, inputs and outputs could be connected to the ANN(s). ODEs are in general not very handy, for modeling **real** applications, a more suitable container for ODEs is needed. The most common model exchange format in industry is the *Functional Mock-up interface* (FMI), models exported with FMI are called *Functional Mock-up unit* (FMU). Especially *model-exchange* FMUs can be seen as containers for ODEs. For more information, see ([fmi-standard.org](http://fmi-standard.org/)). So if you want to use a real model from your modeling tool (with FMI support), you can simply export a FMU instead of handling large and bulky ODEs. If PeNODEs use FMUs instead of ODEs, they are called NeuralFMUs [[2]](#Source).\n",

        "Besides shifting and scaling, a major question is: What signals should be fed into the ANN and what signals should be output by it? We need to make some considerations:\n",
        "- **What should be learned?** In theory, we could manipulate every interface signal from and to the FMU, but in real life this is not efficient. The more signals we connect, the more partial derivatives need to be determined during training. So if there is something you know about the model (and often there is more than just *something*) you can use that knowledge to make your hybrid model more efficient. So ask yourself: *What* should be learned? And right after that: *How* could it be learned? In mechanical applications the answer will often be: A force (or momentum in rotational systems). Forces result in a change of acceleration, so they can be expressed by an additional acceleration. In mechanical systems, the acceleration is almost always a state derivative (the derivative of the velocity), so in many cases, manipulating the most differentiated state derivative - the acceleration - is a very good choice. \n",
        "- **How many ANNs do we need?** Technically, you can add an arbitrary number of ANNs around your FMU (you can also use multiple FMUs if you want). But again, one should not use more than a single ANN if there is no good reason to do so. A second ANN *before* the FMU can be useful for example, if measurment offsets or similar effects should be corrected. Often, a single ANN to modify the state dynamics is sufficient.\n",
        "- **What signals from the FMU should be inserted into the ANN?** In theory, we could use them all, meaning all states, state derivatives, time, inputs, outputs and other variables that are accessible through FMI. You know what comes next: Using less signals is the better choice, of course. If you know that the physical effect (here: the friction force), you have also an idea of what *influences* this effect or at least you know what values will have no impact and can be neglected to enhance training performance.\n",
