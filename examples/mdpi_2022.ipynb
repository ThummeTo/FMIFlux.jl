    "## Motivation\n",
    "The Julia Package *FMIFlux.jl* is motivated by the application of hybrid modeling. This package enables the user to integrate his simulation model(s) in form of FMU(s) between neural networks (NeuralFMU). For more detailed information on *FMIFlux.jl*, see the [introduction page](https://thummeto.github.io/FMIFlux.jl/dev/). This tutorial is an easy, code-focussed version of the paper [[1]](#Source).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to the example\n",
    "In this example, a real-world simulation model is enhanced in terms of accuracy using a so called *physics-enhanced neural ordinary differential equation* (PeNode). Basically, this is an extension to the NeuralODE concept and looks as can be seen in Fig. 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "![PeNODE.svg](https://github.com/thummeto/FMIFlux.jl/blob/main/docs/src/examples/pics/PeNODE.svg?raw=true)\n",
    "\n",
    "*Fig.1: A possible representation for a physics-enhanced neural ordinary differential equation (PeNODE)*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note, that this is only one possible topology, there could be an additional artifical neural network (ANN) before the ODE (that can also share some connections with the other ANN) and other signals, like FMU state derivatives, inputs and outputs could be connected to the ANN(s). ODEs are in general not very handy, for modeling **real** applications, a more suitable format is needed. The most common model exchange format in industry is the *Functional Mock-up interface* (FMI), models exported with FMI are called *Functional Mock-up unit* (FMU). Especially *model-exchange* FMUs can be seen as containers for ODEs. For more information, see ([fmi-standard.org](http://fmi-standard.org/)). So if you want to use a real model from your modeling tool (with FMI support), you can simply export an FMU instead of handling large and bulky ODEs. If PeNODEs use FMUs instead of ODEs, they are called NeuralFMUs [[2]](#Source).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial series, a *vehicle longitudinal-dynamics model* (VLDM) is extended to a NeuralFMU (PeNODE) to make better consumption predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Target group\n",
    "The example is primarily intended for users who work in the field of first principle and/or hybrid modeling and are further interested in hybrid model building. The example wants to show how simple it is to combine FMUs with machine learning and to illustrate the advantages of this approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Other formats\n",
    "Besides, this [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/thummeto/FMIFlux.jl/blob/examples/examples/mdpi_part1_loading.ipynb) there is also a [Julia file](https://github.com/thummeto/FMIFlux.jl/blob/examples/examples/mdpi_part1_loading.jl) with the same name, which contains only the code cells. For the documentation there is a [Markdown file](https://github.com/thummeto/FMIFlux.jl/blob/examples/examples/mdpi_part1_loading.md) corresponding to the notebook.  \n",
