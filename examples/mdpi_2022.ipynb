    "## Introduction to the example\n",
    "The Julia Package *FMIFlux.jl* is motivated by the application of hybrid modeling. This package enables the user to integrate his simulation model(s) in form of FMU(s) side-by-side together with artifical neural networks. For more detailed information on *FMIFlux.jl*, see the [introduction page](https://thummeto.github.io/FMIFlux.jl/dev/). This tutorial is an easy, code-focussed version of the paper [[1]](#Source). If this tutorial is useful for your work, please cite the linked paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, a real-world simulation model is enhanced in terms of accuracy using a so called *physics-enhanced neural ordinary differential equation* (PeNode). Basically, this is an extension to the NeuralODE concept and looks as can be seen in Fig. 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "![NeuralFMU.svg](https://github.com/ThummeTo/FMIFlux.jl/tree/main/examples/img/mdpi_2022/neuralfmu.svg?raw=true)\n",
    "\n",
    "*Fig.1: A possible representation for a physics-enhanced neural ordinary differential equation (PeNODE). PeNODEs that include FMUs instead of symbolic ODEs are called NeuralFMUs.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Note, that this is only one possible topology of a PeNODE, there could be an additional artifical neural network (ANN) before the ODE (that can also share some connections with the other ANN) and other signals, like FMU state derivatives, inputs and outputs could be connected to the ANN(s). ODEs are in general not very handy, for modeling **real** applications, a more suitable container for ODEs is needed. The most common model exchange format in industry is the *Functional Mock-up interface* (FMI), models exported with FMI are called *Functional Mock-up unit* (FMU). Especially *model-exchange* FMUs can be seen as containers for ODEs. For more information, see ([fmi-standard.org](http://fmi-standard.org/)). So if you want to use a real model from your modeling tool (with FMI support), you can simply export an FMU instead of handling large and bulky ODEs. If PeNODEs use FMUs instead of ODEs, they are called NeuralFMUs [[2]](#Source).\n",

    "In this tutorial series, a *vehicle longitudinal-dynamics model* (VLDM) is extended to a NeuralFMU (PeNODE) to make better consumption predictions.\n",

    "## Target group\n",
    "The example is primarily intended for users who work in the field of first principle and/or data driven modeling and are further interested in hybrid model building. The example shows how to combine FMUs with machine learning and illustrates the advantages of this approach.\n",

    "Besides shifting and scaling, a major question is: What signals should be fed into the ANN and what signals should be output by it? We need to make some considerations:\n",
    "- **What should be learned?** In theory, we could manipulate every interface signal from an to the FMU, but in real life this is not efficient. The more signals we connect, the more partial derivatives need to be determined during training. So if there is something you know about the model (and often there is more than just *something*) you can use that knowledge to make your hybrid model more efficient. So ask yourself: *What* should be learned? And right after that: *How* could it be learned? In mechanical applications the answer will often be: A force (or momentum in rotational systems). Forces result in a change of acceleration, so they can be expressed by an additional acceleration. In mechanical systems, the acceleration is almost always a state derivative (the derivative of the velocity), so in many cases, manipulating the lowest state derivative - the acceleration - is a very good choice. \n",
    "- **How many ANNs do we need?** Technically, you can add an arbitrary number of ANNs around your FMU (you can also use multiple FMUs if you want). But again, one should not use more than a single ANN if there is no good reason to do so. A second ANN *before* the FMU can be useful for example, if measurment offsets or similar effects should be corrected. Often, a single ANN to modify the state dynamics is sufficient.\n",
    "- **What signals from the FMU should be inserted into the ANN?** In theory, we could use them all, meaning all states, state derivatives, time, inputs, outputs and other variables that are accessible through FMI. You know what comes next: Using less signals is the better choice, of course. If you know that the physical effect (here: the friction force), you have also an idea what *influences* this effect or at least you know what values will have no impact and can be neglected to enhance training performance.\n",
