# Overview

This section discusses the included examples of the FMIFlux.jl library. So you can execute them on your machine and get detailed information about all of the steps. If you require further information about the function calls, see [library functions](@ref library) section. For more information related to the setup and simulation of an FMU see [FMI.jl library](https://thummeto.github.io/FMI.jl/dev/).

The examples are:

- __Simple hybrid CS__: Showing how to train a Neural CS FMU.
- __simple hybrid ME__: Showing how to train a Neural ME FMU.
- __advanced hybrid ME__: Showing how to train an advanced Neural ME FMU.
