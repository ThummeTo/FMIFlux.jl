# Examples - Overview

This section discusses the included examples of the FMIFlux.jl library. You can execute them on your machine and get detailed information about all of the steps. 
If you require further information about the function calls, see [library functions](https://thummeto.github.io/FMIFlux.jl/dev/library/) section. 
For more information related to the setup and simulation of an FMU see [FMI.jl library](https://thummeto.github.io/FMI.jl/dev/).

The examples are intended for users who work in the field of first principle and/or data driven modeling and are further interested in hybrid model building. 
The examples show how to combine FMUs with machine learning ("NeuralFMU") and illustrates the advantages of this approach.
