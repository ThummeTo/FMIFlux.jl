## What is FMIFlux.jl?
FMIFlux.jl is a free-to-use software library for the Julia programming language, which offers the ability to setup NeuralFMUs: You can place FMUs ([fmi-standard.org](http://fmi-standard.org/)) simply inside any feed-forward NN topology and still keep the resulting hybrid model trainable with a standard AD training process.
