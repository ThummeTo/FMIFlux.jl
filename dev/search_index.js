Further also other signals, like FMU state derivatives, inputs and outputs could be connected to the ANN(s). ODEs are in general not very handy, for modeling real applications, a more suitable container for ODEs is needed. The most common model exchange format in industry is the Functional Mock-up interface (FMI), models exported with FMI are called Functional Mock-up unit (FMU). Especially model-exchange FMUs can be seen as containers for ODEs. For more information, see (fmi-standard.org). So if you want to use a real model from your modeling tool (with FMI support), you can simply export a FMU instead of handling large and bulky ODEs.

We need to make some considerations:","category":"page"},{"location":"examples/mdpi_2022/","page":"Physics-enhanced NeuralODEs in real-world applications","title":"Physics-enhanced NeuralODEs in real-world applications","text":"What should be learned? In theory, we could manipulate every interface signal from and to the FMU, but in real life this is not efficient. The more signals we connect, the more partial derivatives need to be determined during training. So if there is something you know about the model (and often there is more than just something) you can use that knowledge to make your hybrid model more efficient. So ask yourself: What should be learned? And right after that: How could it be learned? In mechanical applications the answer will often be: A force (or momentum in rotational systems). Forces result in a change of acceleration, so they can be expressed by an additional acceleration. In mechanical systems, the acceleration is almost always a state derivative (the derivative of the velocity), so in many cases, manipulating the most differentiated state derivative - the acceleration - is a very good choice. \nHow many ANNs do we need? Technically, you can add an arbitrary number of ANNs around your FMU (you can also use multiple FMUs if you want). But again, one should not use more than a single ANN if there is no good reason to do so. A second ANN before the FMU can be useful for example, if measurment offsets or similar effects should be corrected. Often, a single ANN to modify the state dynamics is sufficient.\nWhat signals from the FMU should be inserted into the ANN? In theory, we could use them all, meaning all states, state derivatives, time, inputs, outputs and other variables that are accessible through FMI. You know what comes next: Using less signals is the better choice, of course. If you know that the physical effect (here: the friction force), you have also an idea of what influences this effect or at least you know what values will have no impact and can be neglected to enhance training performance.","category":"page"},{"location":"examples/mdpi_2022/","page":"Physics-enhanced NeuralODEs in real-world applications","title":"Physics-enhanced NeuralODEs in real-world applications","text":"At this specific example, the following considerations were made:","category":"page"},{"location":"examples/mdpi_2022/","page":"Physics-enhanced NeuralODEs in real-world applications","title":"Physics-enhanced NeuralODEs in real-world applications","text":" Consideration Considered inputs for the ANN\n1. we have no system inputs, so vecu=, nothing to add \n2. we have no system outputs, so vecy=, nothing to add \n3. we know that the effect is not explicitly time-dependent on t, nothing to add \n4. we have six states, that may influence the effect, add them x_1 x_2 x_3 x_4 x_5 x_6\n5. we have six state derivatives, that may influence the effect, add them x_1 x_2 x_3 x_4 x_5 x_6 dotx_1 dotx_2 dotx_3 dotx_4 dotx_5 dotx_6\n6. the system is modelled as second order ODE, the state x_5 (velocity) equlas the state derivative dotx_4, remove x_5 x_1 x_2 x_3 x_4 x_6 dotx_1 dotx_2 dotx_3 dotx_4 dotx_5 dotx_6\n7. we know that the friction effect is not dependent on the driver controller, remove two states (x_1 and x_2) and state derivatives (dotx_1 and dotx_2) x_3 x_4 x_6 dotx_3 dotx_4 dotx_5 dotx_6\n8. we know that the friction effect is not dependent on the target driving cycle position x_3 or velocity dotx_3, remove them x_4 x_6 dotx_4 dotx_5 dotx_6\n9. we assume that the friction effect is not dependent on the vehicle position x_4, remove x_4 x_6 dotx_4 dotx_5 dotx_6\n10. we assume that the friction effect is not dependent on the accumulated vehicle consumption x_6, remove x_6 dotx_4 dotx_5 dotx_6","category":"page"},{"location":"examples/mdpi_2022/","page":"Physics-enhanced NeuralODEs in real-world applications","title":"Physics-enhanced NeuralODEs in real-world applications","text":"These considerations lead to the following topology:","category":"page"},{"location":"examples/mdpi_2022/","page":"Physics-enhanced NeuralODEs in real-world applications","title":"Physics-enhanced NeuralODEs in real-world applications","text":"(Image: usedneuralfmu.svg)","category":"page"},{"location":"examples/mdpi_2022/","page":"Physics-enhanced NeuralODEs in real-world applications","title":"Physics-enhanced NeuralODEs in real-world applications","text":"Fig.2: The used topology for a NeuralFMU in this example.

This package enables the user to integrate his simulation model between neural networks (NeuralFMU). For this, the simulation model must be exported as FMU (functional mock-up unit), which corresponds to a widely used standard. The big advantage of hybrid modeling with artificial neural networks is, that effects that are difficult to model (because they might be unknown) can be easily learned by the neural networks. For this purpose, the NeuralFMU is trained with measurement data containing the not modeled physical effect. The final product is a simulation model including the originally not modeled effects. Another big advantage of the NeuralFMU is that it works with little data, because the FMU already contains the characteristic functionality of the simulation and only the missing effects are added.","category":"page"},{"location":"examples/simple_hybrid_ME/","page":"Simple ME-NeuralFMU","title":"Simple ME-NeuralFMU","text":"NeuralFMUs do not need to be as easy as in this example.

The simpleFMU is then integrated into a NeuralFMU architecture and a training of the entire network is performed. After the training the final state is compared again to the realFMU.

This package enables the user to integrate his simulation model between neural networks (NeuralFMU). For this, the simulation model must be exported as FMU (functional mock-up unit), which corresponds to a widely used standard. The big advantage of hybrid modeling with artificial neural networks is, that effects that are difficult to model (because they might be unknown) can be easily learned by the neural networks. For this purpose, the NeuralFMU is trained with measurement data containing the not modeled physical effect. The final product is a simulation model including the originally not modeled effects. Another big advantage of the NeuralFMU is that it works with little data, because the FMU already contains the characteristic functionality of the simulation and only the missing effects are added.","category":"page"},{"location":"examples/simple_hybrid_CS/","page":"Simple CS-NeuralFMU","title":"Simple CS-NeuralFMU","text":"NeuralFMUs do not need to be as easy as in this example.

The model with the shifted initial position serves as reference and is called referenceFMU in the following. The model with the default position is further referenced with defaultFMU. At the beginning, the actual state of both simulations is shown, whereby clear deviations can be seen in the graphs. Afterwards, the defaultFMU is integrated into a co-simulation NeuralFMU (CS-NeuralFMU) architecture.

The simpleFMU is then integrated into a NeuralFMU architecture and a training of the entire network is performed. After the training the final state is compared again to the realFMU.

At the beginning, the actual state of both simulations is shown, whereby clear deviations can be seen in the graphs. In addition, the initial states are changed for both models and these graphs are also contrasted, and the differences can again be clearly seen. The realFMU serves as a reference graph. The simpleFMU is then integrated into a NeuralFMU architecture and a training of the entire network is performed. After the training the final state is compared again to the realFMU. It can be clearly seen that by using the NeuralFMU, learning of the friction process has taken place.

Also in this function, the graphs of the three FMUs are compared in a plot.","category":"page"},{"location":"examples/modelica_conference_2021/","page":"Modelica Conference 2021","title":"Modelica Conference 2021","text":"function plot_displacement_model(realSimData, netTop, displacements, tSave, displacement)\r\n    linestyles = [:dot, :solid]\r\n    \r\n    posReal = fmi2GetSolutionValue(realSimData, \"mass.s\")\r\n    \r\n    push!(displacements, zeros(length(posReal)))\r\n    for i in 1:length(posReal)\r\n        displacements[end][i] = netTop([posReal[i], 0.0])[1] - posReal[i] - displacement\r\n    end\r\n\r\n    run = length(displacements)\r\n    fig = generate_figure(\"Displacement model $(run)\", \"t [s]\", \"displacement [m]\")\r\n    Plots.plot!(fig, [tSave[1], tSave[end]], [displacement, displacement], label=\"simpleFMU\", linewidth=2)\r\n    Plots.plot!(fig, [tSave[1], tSave[end]], [0.0, 0.0], label=\"reference\", linewidth=2)\r\n    for i in 1:run\r\n        Plots.plot!(fig, tSave, displacements[i], label=\"NeuralFMU ($(i*2500))\", \r\n                    linewidth=2, linestyle=linestyles[i], linecolor=:green)\r\n    end\r\n\r\n    Plots.display(fig)\r\n    \r\n    return displacements\r\nend","category":"page"},{"location":"examples/modelica_conference_2021/#Structure-of-the-NeuralFMU","page":"Modelica Conference 2021","title":"Structure of the NeuralFMU","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"examples/modelica_conference_2021/","page":"Modelica Conference 2021","title":"Modelica Conference 2021","text":"In the following, the topology of the NeuralFMU is constructed. It consists of a dense layer that has exactly as many inputs and outputs as the model has states numStates (and therefore state derivatives). It also sets the initial weights and offsets for the first dense layer, as well as the activation function, which consists of the identity. An input layer follows, which then leads into the simpleFMU model. The ME-FMU computes the state derivatives for a given system state. Following the simpleFMU is a dense layer that has numStates states. The output of this layer consists of 8 output nodes and a identity activation function. The next layer has 8 input and output nodes with a tanh activation function. The last layer is again a dense layer with 8 input nodes and the number of states as outputs. Here, it is important that no tanh-activation function follows, because otherwise the pendulums state values would be limited to the interval -11.","category":"page"},{"location":"examples/modelica_conference_2021/","page":"Modelica Conference 2021","title":"Modelica Conference 2021","text":"# NeuralFMU setup\r\nnumStates = fmiGetNumberOfStates(simpleFMU)\r\n\r\n# diagonal matrix \r\ninitW = zeros(numStates, numStates)\r\nfor i in 1:numStates\r\n    initW[i,i] = 1\r\nend\r\n\r\nnet = Chain(Dense(numStates, numStates,  identity),\r\n            x -> simpleFMU(x=x),\r\n            Dense(numStates, 8, identity),\r\n            Dense(8, 8, tanh),\r\n            Dense(8, numStates))","category":"page"},{"location":"examples/modelica_conference_2021/#Definition-of-the-NeuralFMU","page":"Modelica Conference 2021","title":"Definition of the NeuralFMU","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"examples/modelica_conference_2021/","page":"Modelica Conference 2021","title":"Modelica Conference 2021","text":"The instantiation of the ME-NeuralFMU is done as a one-liner.
