This package enables the user to integrate his simulation model between neural networks (NeuralFMU). For this, the simulation model must be exported as FMU (functional mock-up unit), which corresponds to a widely used standard. The big advantage of hybrid modeling with artificial neural networks is, that effects that are difficult to model (because they might be unknown) can be easily learned by the neural networks. For this purpose, the NeuralFMU is trained with measurement data containing the not modeled physical effect. The final product is a simulation model including the originally not modeled effects. Another big advantage of the NeuralFMU is that it works with little data, because the FMU already contains the characteristic functionality of the simulation and only the missing effects are added.","category":"page"},{"location":"examples/simple_hybrid_CS/","page":"Simple CS-NeuralFMU","title":"Simple CS-NeuralFMU","text":"NeuralFMUs do not need to be as easy as in this example. Basically a NeuralFMU can combine different ANN topologies that manipulate any FMU-input (system state, system inputs, time) and any FMU-output (system state derivative, system outputs, other system variables).

For this purpose, on the one hand the initial position of the mass of the pendulum is shifted and on the other hand the default position of the mass from the model is used. The model with the shifted initial position serves as reference and is called referenceFMU in the following. The model with the default position is further referenced with defaultFMU. At the beginning, the actual state of both simulations is shown, whereby clear deviations can be seen in the graphs. Afterwards, the defaultFMU is integrated into a co-simulation NeuralFMU (CS-NeuralFMU) architecture. By training the NeuralFMU, an attempt is made to learn the initial displacement of the referenceFMU. It can be clearly seen that the NeuralFMU learns this shift well in just a few training steps.

This package enables the user to integrate his simulation model between neural networks (NeuralFMU). For this, the simulation model must be exported as FMU (functional mock-up unit), which corresponds to a widely used standard. The big advantage of hybrid modeling with artificial neural networks is, that effects that are difficult to model (because they might be unknown) can be easily learned by the neural networks. For this purpose, the NeuralFMU is trained with measurement data containing the not modeled physical effect. The final product is a simulation model including the originally not modeled effects. Another big advantage of the NeuralFMU is that it works with little data, because the FMU already contains the characteristic functionality of the simulation and only the missing effects are added.","category":"page"},{"location":"examples/advanced_hybrid_ME/","page":"Advanced ME-NeuralFMU","title":"Advanced ME-NeuralFMU","text":"NeuralFMUs do not need to be as easy as in this example.

The FMU with the simplified model will be named simpleFMU in the following and the model with the friction will be named realFMU. At the beginning, the actual state of both simulations is shown, whereby clear deviations can be seen in the graphs. The realFMU serves as a reference graph. The simpleFMU is then integrated into a NeuralFMU architecture and a training of the entire network is performed. After the training the final state is compared again to the realFMU. It can be clearly seen that by using the NeuralFMU, learning of the friction process has taken place.

This package enables the user to integrate his simulation model between neural networks (NeuralFMU). For this, the simulation model must be exported as FMU (functional mock-up unit), which corresponds to a widely used standard. The big advantage of hybrid modeling with artificial neural networks is, that the effects that are difficult to model (because they might be unknown) can be easily learned by the neural networks. For this purpose, the NeuralFMU is trained with measurement data containing the not modeled physical effect. The final product is a simulation model including the originally not modeled effects. Another big advantage of the NeuralFMU is that it works with little data, because the FMU already contains the characteristic functionality of the simulation and only the missing effects are added.","category":"page"},{"location":"examples/modelica_conference_2021/","page":"Modelica Conference 2021","title":"Modelica Conference 2021","text":"NeuralFMUs do not need to be as easy as in this example.

At the beginning, the actual state of both simulations is shown, whereby clear deviations can be seen in the graphs. In addition, the initial states are changed for both models and these graphs are also contrasted, and the differences can again be clearly seen. The realFMU serves as a reference graph. The simpleFMU is then integrated into a NeuralFMU architecture and a training of the entire network is performed. After the training the final state is compared again to the realFMU.

The plots for the opposition of position and velocity is done in line 13 by calling the function plot_all_results. In the following lines the last layers are extracted from the neuralFMU and formed into an independent network netBottom. The parameters for the netBottom network come from the original architecture and are shared. In line 20, the new network is used to represent the friction model in a graph.

This package enables the user to integrate his simulation model between neural networks (NeuralFMU). For this, the simulation model must be exported as FMU (functional mock-up unit), which corresponds to a widely used standard. The big advantage of hybrid modeling with artificial neural networks is, that effects that are difficult to model (because they might be unknown) can be easily learned by the neural networks. For this purpose, the NeuralFMU is trained with measurement data containing the not modeled physical effect. The final product is a simulation model including the originally not modeled effects. Another big advantage of the NeuralFMU is that it works with little data, because the FMU already contains the characteristic functionality of the simulation and only the missing effects are added.","category":"page"},{"location":"examples/simple_hybrid_ME/","page":"Simple ME-NeuralFMU","title":"Simple ME-NeuralFMU","text":"NeuralFMUs do not need to be as easy as in this example.

The FMU with the simplified model will be named simpleFMU in the following and the model with the friction will be named realFMU. At the beginning, the actual state of both simulations is shown, whereby clear deviations can be seen in the graphs. The realFMU serves as a reference graph. The simpleFMU is then integrated into a NeuralFMU architecture and a training of the entire network is performed. After the training the final state is compared again to the realFMU. It can be clearly seen that by using the NeuralFMU, learning of the friction process has taken place.
